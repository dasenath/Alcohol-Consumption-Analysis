# Alcohol-Consumption-Analysis
Intent of the program
The program attempts to create an optimal neural network for the drug consumption dataset.

The details of the dataset can be found here "UCI Machine Learning Repository: Drug consumption (quantified) Data Set" https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29

NOTE: The code only supports .csv and the file from the UCI first needs to be converted from .data to .csv. The .data file only contains the rows and not the headers and hence the column names must be added to the .data file and then convert the file to .csv.
